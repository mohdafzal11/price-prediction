        "Moving averages are among the most popular DroomDroom price prediction tools. As the name suggests, a moving average provides the average closing price for DROOM over a selected time frame, which is divided into a number of periods of the same length. For example, a 12-day simple moving average for DROOM is a sum of DROOM's closing prices over the last 12 days which is then divided by 12.",
        "In addition to the simple moving average (SMA), traders also use another type of moving average called the exponential moving average (EMA). The EMA gives more weight to more recent prices, and therefore reacts more quickly to recent price action.",
        "50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages are among the most commonly used indicators in the crypto market to identify important resistance and support levels. If the DROOM price moves above any of these averages, it is generally seen as a bullish sign for DroomDroom. Conversely, a drop below an important moving average is usually a sign of weakness in the DROOM market.",
        "Traders also like to use the RSI and Fibonacci retracement level indicators to try and ascertain the future direction of the DROOM price."

        "Most traders use candlestick charts, as they provide more information than a simple line chart. Traders can view candlesticks that represent the price action of DroomDroom with different granularity â€“ for example, you could choose a 5-minute candlestick chart for extremely short-term price action or choose a weekly candlestick chart to identify long-terms trends. 1-hour, 4-hour and 1-day candlestick charts are among the most popular.",
        "Let's use a 1-hour candlestick chart as an example of how this type of price chart gives us information about opening and closing prices. The chart is divided into \"candles\" that give us information about DroomDroom's price action in 1-hour chunks. Each candlestick will display DROOM's opening price, closing price, as well as the highest and lowest prices that DroomDroom reached within the 1-hour period."

        "Just like with any other asset, the price action of DroomDroom is driven by supply and demand.

Regulations, adoption by companies and governments, cryptocurrency exchange hacks, and other real-world events can also affect the price of DROOM. The market capitalization of DroomDroom can change significantly in a short period of time.",
        "When trying to make a DroomDroom forecast, many traders also try to monitor the activity of DROOM 'whales', which are entities and individuals that control large amounts of DROOM. Since the DroomDroom market is relatively small compared to traditional markets, whales can single-handedly have a big influence on DroomDroom's price movements."
